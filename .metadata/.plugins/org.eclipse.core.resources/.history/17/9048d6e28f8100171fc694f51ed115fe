				+ " a cheat-sheet. The teacher doesn't notice.\nAsk to share the cheat-sheet."
				+ " This test isn't fair, so why should you be?\n1- Good for them, they beat "
				+ "the system.\n2- Confront them after the test and try to convince them not to"
				+ " cheat anymore. You don't want them to get in trouble.\n3- Confront them after"
				+ " the test and force them to tell the teacher they cheated, or you will tell on them."
				+ " They must pay for their misdeeds.\n4- Inform the teacher right in the middle of class"
				+ " that they are cheating. Cheaters never prosper!");

				+ "money in it, but no identification of any kind. There is nobody in sight.\n1- Leave it there. Someone is "
				+ "probably looking for it.\n2- Pocket the money. You don't know who it belongs to, so finder's keepers.\n3-"
				+ " Take it to the police in case anyone ever reports it.\n4- Take the wallet, and go around the area"

				+ " everyone begins laughing at you. However, you doubt they meant any harm by it.\n1- "
				+ "Laugh along with the crowd. You love a good joke even if it's at your expense.\n2- On"
				+ " the outside you'll laugh because you don't want anyone to know that they really hurt "
				+ "your feelings by making you look stupid in front of everybody.\n3- You get upset and run"
				+ " away from the crowd. How could they be so mean?\n4- That jerk! You get mad right away "
				+ "and tell it to their face.\n5- Pretend that all is well, but you won't forget this. "
				+ "They're going to pay for what they did! How dare they publicly humiliate you.");
		
		questions.add("4.) You have arrived late to work because you had a flat tire. You've been on "
				+ "time every other day for the past month, yet your boss yells at you about it in"
				+ " front of all your coworkers.\n1- Endure his yelling, he is my boss after all.\n2- "
				+ "Let him yell, it doesn't matter anyway, you're not listening.\n3- Explain to him "
				+ "that accidents happen and that you don't feel you need to be yelled at because of "
				+ "it.\n4- Yell right back at him! How dare he insult you for something so petty.\n5-"
				+ " Allow him to yell all he wants, you'll just let the air out of his tires someday.");
