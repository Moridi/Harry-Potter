				+ "the system.\n2- Confront them after the test and try to convince them not to"
				+ " cheat anymore. You don't want them to get in trouble.\n3- Confront them after"

				+ " the outside you'll laugh because you don't want anyone to know that they really hurt "
				+ "your feelings by making you look stupid in front of everybody.\n3- You get upset and run"
				+ " away from the crowd. How could they be so mean?\n4- That jerk! You get mad right away "
				+ "and tell it to their face.\n5- Pretend that all is well, but you won't forget this. "
				+ "They're going to pay for what they did! How dare they publicly humiliate you.")
