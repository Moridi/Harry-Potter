		questions.add("1.) You are given a test at school that has"
				+ " questions that teacher hasn't covered yet. "
				+ "In the middle of the test you notice that your friend next to you has"
				+ " a cheat-sheet. The teacher doesn't notice.\nAsk to share the cheat-sheet."
				+ " This test isn't fair, so why should you be?\n1- Good for them, they beat "
				+ "the system.\n2- Confront them after the test and try to convince them not to"
				+ " cheat anymore. You don't want them to get in trouble.\n3- Confront them after"
				+ " the test and force them to tell the teacher they cheated, or you will tell on them."
				+ " They must pay for their misdeeds.\n4- Inform the teacher right in the middle of class"
				+ " that they are cheating. Cheaters never prosper!");

				+ "money in it, but no identification of any kind. There is nobody in sight.\n1- Leave it there. Someone is "
				+ "probably looking for it.\n2- Pocket the money. You don't know who it belongs to, so finder's keepers.\n3-"
				+ " Take it to the police in case anyone ever reports it.\n4- Take the wallet, and go around the area"
				+ " asking anyone if they have lost a wallet recently.");
		
		questions.add("3.) Someone has played a prank on you which involves your public embarrassment and"
				+ " everyone begins laughing at you. However, you doubt they meant any harm by it.\n1- "
				+ "Laugh along with the crowd. You love a good joke even if it's at your expense.\n2- On"
				+ " the outside you'll laugh because you don't want anyone to know that they really hurt "
				+ "your feelings by making you look stupid in front of everybody.\n3- You get upset and run"
				+ " away from the crowd. How could they be so mean?\n4- That jerk! You get mad right away "
				+ "and tell it to their face.\n5- Pretend that all is well, but you won't forget this. "
				+ "They're going to pay for what they did! How dare they publicly humiliate you.");
		
		questions.add("4.) You have arrived late to work because you had a flat tire. You've been on "
				+ "time every other day for the past month, yet your boss yells at you about it in"
				+ " front of all your coworkers.\n1- Endure his yelling, he is my boss after all.\n2- "
				+ "Let him yell, it doesn't matter anyway, you're not listening.\n3- Explain to him "
				+ "that accidents happen and that you don't feel you need to be yelled at because of "
				+ "it.\n4- Yell right back at him! How dare he insult you for something so petty.\n5-"
				+ " Allow him to yell all he wants, you'll just let the air out of his tires someday.");
		
		questions.add("5.) You have just returned home from a long day's work when a friend calls you and"
				+ " explains that they are stranded on a back road an hour drive from town and they need you"
				+ " to pick them up. They've already tried everyone else and you are their only means of "
				+ "getting back.\n1- I'm too tired. Tell them to try to flag down a car to help them out.\n2- "
				+ "I'm too tired. Make up a lie about why you can't help them.\n3- I'll do it, but I'm charging"
				+ " them for gas money.\n4- Yes, I'm tired, but what are friends for?\n5- Ask them what's wrong "
				+ "with the car. Maybe you can talk them through how to fix it.");
		
		questions.add("6.) A little kid accuses you, in front of a whole crowd people, of stealing his toy"
				+ " which you did not do. You are twice his size, but he won't back off.\n1- How dare he "
				+ "insult me in front of all these people? I'll show him how things work in the real world"
				+ "!\n2- Explain to him that I didn't take his toy and give him fair warning that he'll"
				+ " have a black eye if he doesn't drop it.\n3- Try to rationalize with the kid. Tell him"
				+ " you didn't take the toy and refuse to fight him even if he takes a few swings at you"
				+ ".\n4- Tell him you didn't take the toy and direct him to someone who can help him find"
				+ " it.\n5- Explain to him you didn't take the toy and offer to personally help find the "
				+ "person who did.");
		
		questions.add("7.) You have saved up for months to buy a new bike. As you're getting ready to buy it"
				+ ", a child runs by and steals your money. You chase him down and find that his mother is "
				+ "deathly ill and the child stole the money to buy her medicine.\n1- That's their problem, "
				+ "I didn't get the lady sick. I worked hard for that money and it's mine.\n2- Perhaps you"
				+ " would have helped them if they were to ask, but you don't help thieves.\n3- Maybe I'll "
				+ "let them keep some of the money and buy the bike later.\n4- They are obviously in need of"
				+ " the money more than I. I give it all to them.\n5- I'll give them the money and try and "
				+ "nurse the mother back to health.\n6- Refuse to give them your money, but still try and "
				+ "nurse the mother back to health.");
		
		questions.add("8.) A friend of yours tells you that there is some really cool stuff in an old abandoned"
				+ " building. When you get there you see a sign that \"Danger: Do not enter!\", but the building"
						+ " doesn't look dangerous. There is nobody around to see you, and your friend wants "
						+ "to check it out.\n1- Obviously there is some dangerous stuff in there, and we "
						+ "shouldn't be going inside.\n2- Maybe I'll just take a peek inside for a little "
						+ "while. What could it hurt?\n3- Danger shmanger! There's probably some cool stuff"
						+ " inside. Let's see what all the fuss is about.");
